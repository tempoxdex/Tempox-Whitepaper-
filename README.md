## 🔥 Why Perpetuals Are Broken Today

Current perpetual DEXs treat all moments the same.  
But in real markets:

- 🕒 **1-hour leverage ≠ 7-day leverage**  
- 📉 **Price before CPI ≠ price after CPI**  
- 🌪️ **Risk in calm ≠ risk in chaos**

Yet protocols ignore **time** and **context** → leading to:  
❌ Unfair liquidations  
❌ Zombie positions  
❌ Systemic fragility during black-swan events

## 💡 TempoX: Perpetuals That Understand Time & Events

We introduce **three adaptive layers** that make trading smarter, safer, and more realistic:

### 1. ⏳ **Time-Decay Leverage**  
Leverage automatically decreases over time:  
`L(t) = L₀ · e^(-λt)`  
→ Encourages active trading  
→ Reduces long-term systemic risk  

### 2. 🌍 **Event-Driven Pricing**  
Contract prices react to real-world events:  
- Fed rate decisions  
- CPI/Inflation data  
- Major DAO votes  
- Macro shocks  
→ Powered by **Chainlink Functions**  

### 3. 🤖 **Risk Pulse Score**  
Every position gets a real-time health score based on:  
- Duration  
- Historical volatility  
- Upcoming events  
→ Used to adjust **funding rates fairly**:  
✅ Low-risk positions → lower fees  
⚠️ High-risk positions → higher fees (paid to LPs)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (No Token. No Fluff.)

| Layer | Tech |
|------|------|
| **Chain** | Arbitrum (low fees, high speed) |
| **Oracle** | Chainlink Functions + Data Feeds |
| **Fee Model** | 0.1% in USDC/ETH (no native token at launch) |
| **LP Rewards** | Trading fees + optional prediction bonuses |
| **Frontend** | React + Web3Modal (coming soon) |

> ✨ **Why no token?**  
> We believe utility comes first. Token will only launch when the protocol generates real value.
